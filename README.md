c4
==

**c4**, stands for **Connect Four**, is a browser game in JavaScript using HTML5 features (canvas). I also incorporate an AI using Minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning. The evaluation function is hard-coded, and hence the AI may not be moving using the most optimal move.

## Play
* [kenrick95.github.io/c4/demo](//kenrick95.github.io/c4/demo/)

### Objective
